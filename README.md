# BANK_USER_CHURN_ANALYSYS

CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION IN BANKING INDUSTRY

• Leveraged Python to build predictive algorithms for a bank(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radheshyamkollipara/bank-customer-churn/data), 
aiming to forecast customer churn likelihood using labeled historical data, preprocessed dataset by performing data cleaning, categorical feature transformation, and
standardization

• Trained classic supervised ML models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K - Nearest Neighbors. Applied
regularization with tuned hyperparameters to avoid overfitting

• Assessed model performance (Accuracy, F1 - score) via k - fold cross - validation. Analyzed feature importance to
pinpoint top drivers of customer churn for the bank

• Random Forest achieved 85.9% accuracy, 80.4% precision, 41.1% recall, AUC 0.85, clearly outperforming logistic
regression and KNN, and effectively pinpointed high-risk customers to guide retention strategies.
